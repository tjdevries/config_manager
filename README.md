# config_manager

This is TJ's configuration repo. Feel free to use whatever you would like from it! It'd be great if you mentioned where it came from if you think it's cool.

If you like what I'm doing, consider supporting me by clicking the heart button above!

Major areas include:

## xdg_config

This area contains configuration I want to share between machines that will go to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (generally, `~/.config`).


Subdirectories include:

### Neovim

Check the `nvim` folder for configuration. For more instruction, see the README there.

Ignore the vim folder, it's out-of-date.
