--[[ Notes to people reading my configuration!

Much of the configuration of individual plugins you can find in either:

./plugin/*.lua
  This is where many of the new plugin configurations live.

  These are sourced by using https://github.com/tjdevries/astronauta.nvim
  You can check out the readme there for more info.

./after/plugin/*.vim
  This is where configuration for plugins live.

  They get auto sourced on startup. In general, the name of the file configures
  the plugin with the corresponding name.

./lua/tj/*.lua
  This is where configuration/extensions for new style plugins live.

  They don't get sourced automatically, but do get sourced by doing something like:

    require('tj.dap')

  or similar. I generally recommend that people do this so that you don't accidentally
  override any of the plugin requires with namespace clashes. So don't just put your configuration
  in "./lua/dap.lua" because then it will override the plugin version of "dap.lua"
