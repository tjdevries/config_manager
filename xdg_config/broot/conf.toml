###############################################################
# Default flags
# You can set up flags you want broot to start with by
# default, for example `default_flags="ihp"` if you usually want
# to see hidden and gitignored files and the permissions (then
# if you don't want the hidden files you can launch `br -H`)
# A popular flag is the `g` one which displays git related info.
#
default_flags = ""

# Verbs and shortcuts

# If $EDITOR isn't set on your computer, you should either set it using
#  something similar to
#   export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nvim
#  or just replace it with your editor of choice in the 'execution'
#  pattern.
# Example:
#  execution = "/usr/bin/nvim {file}"
#
[[verbs]]
invocation = "edit"
key = "F2"
shortcut = "e"
execution = "$EDITOR {file}"

[[verbs]]
key = "ctrl-c"
execution = ":quit"

[[verbs]]
invocation = "create {subpath}"
execution = "$EDITOR {directory}/{subpath}"

[[verbs]]
invocation = "git_diff"
shortcut = "gd"
execution = "git diff {file}"

# If $PAGER isn't set on your computer, you should either set it
#  or just replace it with your viewer of choice in the 'execution'
#  pattern.
# Example:
#  execution = "less {file}"
[[verbs]]
name = "view"
invocation = "view"
execution = "$PAGER {file}"

# If you uncomment the two next shortcuts, the left
# and right arrow keys will be used to go to the parent
# directory or to open a selected one:
#
# [[verbs]]
# key = "left"
# execution = ":parent"
#
# [[verbs]]
# key = "right"
# execution = ":focus"

# Another popular set of shorctuts for going up and down:
#
# [[verbs]]
# key = "ctrl-j"
# execution = ":line_down"
#
# [[verbs]]
# key = "ctrl-k"
# execution = ":line_up"
#
# [[verbs]]
# key = "ctrl-d"
# execution = ":page_down"
#
# [[verbs]]
# key = "ctrl-u"
# execution = ":page_up"

# If you develop using git, you might like to often switch
# to the "git status" filter:
#
# [[verbs]]
# key = "ctrl-g"
# execution = ":toggle_git_status"
